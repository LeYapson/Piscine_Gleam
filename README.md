# Learn Gleam Programming Language

Welcome to the Learn Gleam Programming Language repository! This repository is designed to provide resources and examples for those interested in learning Gleam, a statically typed functional programming language for building maintainable and scalable software.

## What is Gleam?

[Gleam](https://gleam.run/) is a modern programming language built for the Erlang VM (BEAM). It aims to bring the robustness and fault tolerance of Erlang to the world of statically typed functional programming. Gleam provides a strong static type system, pattern matching, and lightweight concurrency primitives, making it an excellent choice for building concurrent and distributed systems.

## Getting Started

If you're new to Gleam, here are a few steps to get started:

1. **Install Gleam**: Follow the installation instructions provided in the [official documentation](https://gleam.run/getting-started/installing.html) to install Gleam on your system.

2. **Explore Examples**: Check out the `examples` directory in this repository to explore various Gleam code examples covering different aspects of the language.

3. **Read Documentation**: Refer to the [official Gleam documentation](https://gleam.run/getting-started/index.html) for in-depth guides, tutorials, and language reference.
